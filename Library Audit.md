## 🔑 Key Exports

```ts
import {
  fetcher,
  websocket,
  apiConfig,
  APIError,
  parseAPIError
} from '@trinity/api-client';
````

* `fetcher(url, options)` – Promise-based fetch with error parsing
* `websocket(url, handlers)` – Initialize a WebSocket client
* `apiConfig` – Environment-aware base URL config
* `APIError`, `parseAPIError` – Normalize backend error responses

---

## 🔍 Usage Examples

### REST Fetcher

```ts
const data = await fetcher('/api/user', {
  method: 'GET',
});
```

### WebSocket

```ts
websocket('wss://api.example.com/ws', {
  onMessage: (event) => console.log(event.data),
});
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

* Each module has its own unit test
* Uses `vitest` with isolated logic
* `fetcher.test.ts` covers:

  * success & failure cases
  * APIError parsing
* `websocket.test.ts` includes connection behavior with mocks

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues or Gaps

* ❌ No retry logic or exponential backoff
* ❌ No native support for authenticated WebSocket connections

---

## ✅ Best Practices Summary

* Always use `fetcher` instead of `fetch`
* Handle `APIError` in catch blocks
* Keep WebSocket logic minimal — push app-specific handlers to consumers
* Extend tests for edge cases (e.g., timeout, reconnection)

````

The package provides authentication and authorization support across Trinity apps, including:

* JWT token creation and validation
* Local login strategy
* Two-factor authentication (2FA) with TOTP
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Rate limiting middleware
* Token revocation via a blacklist system
* React hooks and provider for frontend access

---

### 📦 Exports

From the `src/index.ts`, we confirm the following top-level exports:

```ts
export * from './middleware/authenticate';
export * from './middleware/authorize';
export * from './context/AuthProvider';
export * from './context/useAuth';
export * from './utils/AuthError';
```

This matches the documentation draft. All core auth logic is wrapped as:

| Export         | Kind     | Description                                  |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |

| `authorize`    | Function | Role-based authorization middleware          |
| `AuthProvider` | React    | Context provider for auth state              |
| `useAuth`      | Hook     | Access current user and auth status in React |
| `AuthError`    | Class    | Custom error for structured auth handling    |

---

### 📚 Dependencies

In `package.json`, the external dependencies include:

```json
"jsonwebtoken": "^9.x",
"otplib": "^12.x",
"bcryptjs": "^2.x",
"express-rate-limit": "^7.x"
```

These are appropriate and lightweight for the features provided. No unnecessary bloat.

  res.json({ user: req.user });
});
````

### Protecting a Route

```ts
app.get('/admin', authenticate, authorize(['admin']), handler);
```

### React: Auth Context

```tsx
<AuthProvider>
  <App />
</AuthProvider>
```

```ts
const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

* All core modules are tested with `vitest`
* Mocked JWTs and bcrypt hashes
* TOTP secrets and codes are verified using `otplib`
* Rate limiter validated with fake request objects

Run:

```bash
pnpm vitest libs/auth
```

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues or Gaps

The `@trinity/config-eslint` package contains the following files:

1. **`base.mjs`** - Likely the base ESLint configuration.
2. **`index.mjs`** - Potential entry point or a centralized export for the package.
3. **`next.mjs`** - Possibly a Next.js specific ESLint configuration.
4. **`package.json`** - Contains package metadata and dependencies.
5. **`react-internal.mjs`** - Likely an ESLint configuration for React-specific internal settings.
6. **`README.md`** - Documentation for the package.

### 🔍 1. Package Audit

#### Purpose:

This package seems to provide ESLint configurations tailored for various environments, including base, Next.js, and React setups. It centralizes ESLint configurations that can be used across different projects within the monorepo.

#### Exports:

* **`base.mjs`**: Base ESLint configuration.
* **`index.mjs`**: Central export or entry point.
* **`next.mjs`**: Next.js specific configuration.
* **`react-internal.mjs`**: React-specific configuration.
* **`package.json`**: Defines package dependencies and metadata.

#### Dependencies:

I will review the `package.json` file for dependencies. Let me check that next.


### Dependencies:

* **eslint**: Version `^8.57.0`, the core ESLint package.
* **@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin**: Version `^7.6.0`, for TypeScript linting rules.
* **@typescript-eslint/parser**: Version `^7.6.0`, the parser for TypeScript files.
* **@eslint/js**: Version `^9.0.0`, a set of recommended ESLint rules.
* **eslint-plugin-react**: Version `^7.33.2`, for React-specific linting rules.
* **eslint-plugin-react-hooks**: Version `^4.6.0`, for React hooks linting.
* **globals**: Version `^13.23.0`, a package that defines global variables for various environments.

### Types:

The package doesn’t explicitly define TypeScript types, but since it's providing ESLint configurations, there’s no immediate need for types unless we want to type-check the ESLint configuration files themselves.

### Tree-shakeable:

The package should be tree-shakeable since it's composed of individual configuration files (e.g., `base.mjs`, `next.mjs`, etc.) that can be selectively imported into other projects. Its usage across apps will be safe.

---

### 📦 2. Documentation Page Draft

Here’s a documentation draft for `@trinity/config-eslint`:

---

**📘 Overview**
The `@trinity/config-eslint` package provides a set of ESLint configurations to ensure consistent code quality across various JavaScript and TypeScript projects. This includes base configurations, Next.js-specific rules, and React-specific internal rules. It is designed to be used across multiple apps in the Trinity Monorepo.

**🧱 File Structure**

```
config-eslint/
├── base.mjs
├── index.mjs
├── next.mjs
├── package.json
├── project.json
├── react-internal.mjs
└── README.md
```

**🔑 Key Exports**

* **`base.mjs`**: Base ESLint configuration for general use.
* **`index.mjs`**: The main entry point of the configuration package.
* **`next.mjs`**: ESLint configuration for Next.js applications.
* **`react-internal.mjs`**: Internal ESLint configuration for React apps.

**🔍 Usage Examples**
To use the ESLint configurations, you can import them into your own ESLint configuration files. For example:

```js
// .eslintrc.js or .eslintrc.json
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    '@trinity/config-eslint/base',
    '@trinity/config-eslint/next',
    '@trinity/config-eslint/react-internal',
  ],
  // other configurations...
};
```

**🧪 Testing Strategy**
The ESLint configurations are indirectly tested by linting the codebases in which they are applied. For testing purposes:

1. Ensure linting works with the correct configurations.
2. Ensure no ESLint warnings or errors are present in the source code files.

**⚠️ Known Issues or Gaps**

* No dedicated unit tests are present for this package, and direct testing might be difficult since it’s primarily an ESLint configuration.

**✅ Best Practices Summary**

* Always extend from the base configuration.
* Include both `next.mjs` and `react-internal.mjs` if you are working with React and Next.js.
* Regularly update ESLint and related plugins to maintain compatibility with new versions of the libraries.

---

### 🧪 3. Testing & QA

Since this package is focused on ESLint configuration, direct unit tests for the configuration files themselves are generally unnecessary. However, it's important to ensure that the configurations are functional and that linting passes without errors across the various projects using them.

### Next Steps:

* **QA Check**: Ensure that each of the configurations (`base.mjs`, `next.mjs`, `react-internal.mjs`) works as intended when imported into a project.
* **Testing Edge Cases**: Ensure the linting is correctly applied in projects that include React, Next.js, or TypeScript code.

### ⚙️ 4. Setup & Integration

Complete. 

### Summary of Action Items:

1. **Package Audit**: Completed and detailed.
2. **Documentation**: Generated a Notion-style markdown for the ESLint configuration package.
3. **Testing & QA**: Direct tests are not applicable, but it's important to ensure the configurations work as expected in projects.

---

---

### 🔍 1. Package Audit

**Purpose**:
The `@trinity/config-prettier` package provides a Prettier configuration for the entire Trinity Monorepo, ensuring consistent formatting across all projects.

**Exports**:

* The package exports a Prettier configuration via the `index.js` file.

**Dependencies**:

* There are no direct dependencies listed in the `package.json` aside from Prettier itself, which should be installed as a dev dependency.

**Missing Files**:

* All necessary files (`index.js`, `package.json`, and `README.md`) are present.
* The package appears complete for its purpose.

**Types**:

* There are no TypeScript types defined in this package, as it is a configuration package and does not include logic that requires typings.

**Tree-shakeability**:

* This package is not tree-shakeable, as it is a configuration package rather than a library with modular exports. However, it is safe to consume across apps in the monorepo, as it is intended for shared usage.

   module.exports = require('@trinity/config-prettier');
   ```

   > This can be done at the root level for a global configuration, or overridden per package as needed.

3. **Ignored Files**:
   To ignore certain files from formatting, create a `.prettierignore` file:

   ```txt
   /dist
   /coverage
   /.nx/cache
   /.nx/workspace-data
   ```

4. **Running Prettier**:
   To check or format the codebase:

   ```bash
   pnpm prettier --check .
   pnpm prettier --write .
   ```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

This package does not require direct tests as it is a configuration package. Ensure that it is correctly applied across all apps by validating code formatting in the repository.

## ⚠️ Known Issues or Gaps

* None identified.

## ✅ Best Practices Summary

* Use this configuration at the root of the repository or per package to ensure consistent code formatting.
* Ensure `.prettierrc.js` is included in each package or at the root of the project.

## @trinity/config-typescript`

### 🔍 1. Package Audit

* **Purpose**: The `@trinity/config-typescript` package provides standardized TypeScript configuration presets for various projects within the Trinity Monorepo. It aims to ensure consistency in type safety, module resolution, and compiler settings across apps, libraries, and tools.

* **Exports**:

  * `base.json`: Core configuration used for all packages and libraries.
  * `react-library.json`: Adds React/JSX support and types for React components.
  * `nextjs.json`: Adds Next.js-specific settings and disables emits for Next.js apps.

* **Dependencies**: No direct external dependencies mentioned, but the package relies on TypeScript and integrates well with other configuration packages like `@trinity/config-eslint` and `@trinity/config-prettier`.

* **Missing Files**:

  * The `README.md` file is included, which is great for documentation.
  * The `project.json` file is missing, which could be important for defining Nx tasks and the build process.

* **Types**: Types are defined implicitly through the TypeScript configuration settings. No separate type definition files are needed as this is a configuration package rather than a code library.

* **Tree-shakeable**: This package is not directly tree-shakeable in the typical sense since it is a configuration package. However, it is designed to be consumable across different apps and libraries in a monorepo setup without unnecessary dependencies or overhead.

* `useIsMounted.ts`: Mounting status hook
* `useLocalStorage.ts`: Local storage hook

### **`__tests__/` Directory**:

* `useDebounce.test.ts`
* `useDisclosure.test.ts`
* `useEventListener.test.ts`
* `useIsMounted.test.ts`
* `useLocalStorage.test.ts`

It appears that the package is well-structured, and there are test files for each hook. I’ll now proceed to audit the package and generate the documentation as per your request.

### 🔍 **1. Package Audit**

* **Purpose**: This package provides reusable, SSR-safe React hooks for managing state and side effects across Trinity applications.

* **Exports**: The package exports the following hooks:

  * `useDebounce`
  * `useDisclosure`
  * `useEventListener`
  * `useIsMounted`
  * `useLocalStorage`

* **Dependencies**:

  * React (`useEffect`, etc.)
  * TypeScript (for types)

  **Dev Dependencies**:

  * `vitest` (for testing)
  * `@trinity/config-*` (for linting, prettier, and TypeScript setup)

* **Missing Files**: It appears that the package includes:

  * A `README.md`
  * `vitest.config.ts` (for testing configuration)
  * TypeScript config files (`tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.lib.json`, `tsconfig.spec.json`)
  * Linting config (`eslint.config.mjs`)
  * Test files in `__tests__/`

  No major files appear to be missing.

* **Types**: The package uses TypeScript, and types are well-defined in the hook files.

* **Tree-Shakeability**: Yes, the package is modular and can be safely tree-shaken. Each hook is a standalone function, and only the used hooks will be imported into the consuming app.

#### 🌀 **`useDebounce`**

```ts
const [debouncedValue] = useDebounce(value, 300);
```

#### 🎛️ **`useDisclosure`**

```ts
const { isOpen, open, close, toggle } = useDisclosure();
```

#### 🔌 **`useEventListener`**

```ts
useEventListener(window, 'resize', () => console.log('Resized!'));
```

#### 🧩 **`useIsMounted`**

```ts
const isMounted = useIsMounted();
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData().then(() => {
    if (isMounted()) updateState();
  });
}, []);
```

#### 💾 **`useLocalStorage`**

```ts
const [theme, setTheme] = useLocalStorage('theme', 'light');
```

---

### 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

* Tests are written using **Vitest** to cover the core functionality of each hook.
* **Test Coverage** includes:

  * `useDebounce`: Tests debounce behavior and timer logic.
  * `useDisclosure`: Tests open, close, and toggle behavior.
  * `useEventListener`: Tests event listener attachment/removal.
  * `useIsMounted`: Tests component mounting status handling.
  * `useLocalStorage`: Tests syncing with `localStorage`.

---

### ⚠️ **Known Issues or Gaps**

No known issues were identified at this stage.

---

### ✅ **Best Practices Summary**

* Ensure hooks are used only within functional components.
* Avoid placing heavy logic inside hooks; keep them as pure as possible.
* Use SSR-safe hooks for any logic that interacts with the DOM or window.
* Always mock environment-dependent hooks like `localStorage` in tests.

---

### 🧪 **3. Testing & QA**

* The existing tests look comprehensive, covering various behaviors for each hook. The tests appear to validate edge cases, such as checking for component mounting status or syncing with `localStorage`.
* Ensure that the tests are running correctly by executing:

```bash
pnpm vitest libs/hooks
```

---

### ⚙️ **4. Setup & Integration**

* Confirm the package integrates correctly into the apps using it by checking the `package.json` for correct dependencies.
* The integration steps look good; all hooks are designed for easy use across all Trinity apps.

#### **Next Steps**:

* Ensure the `README.md` file is updated to reflect any new changes or features added.
* The package should integrate smoothly with `@trinity/config-eslint`, `@trinity/config-prettier`, and `@trinity/config-typescript` as per the existing structure.

## 🔍 1. Package Audit – `@trinity/i18n`

### 📦 Purpose

`@trinity/i18n` is a runtime internationalization system for Trinity apps. It offers SSR-safe translation loading, middleware-based locale detection, and a React context/hook interface for consuming translations.

### 📤 What It Exports

From `src/index.ts`, this package exports:

* `useTranslation`
* `I18nProvider`
* `middleware`
* `getDictionary`
* `t` (stateless translator)
* `translations` (in-memory store)

### 🧩 Dependencies

* ✅ Peer integrations with:

  * React (via context)
  * Next.js (via middleware export)
  * Dynamic imports (for dictionary loading)
* ✅ Internal dependency on `@trinity/locales` for JSON language files
* ✅ Uses `vitest` for testing, Tailwind + ESLint/Prettier for formatting

### 📄 Missing or Incomplete Files

* ✅ `README.md` is already detailed
* ✅ `vitest.config.ts` is defined
* ✅ `*.test.ts[x]` files exist and cover all logic

### ✅ Type Safety & Reusability

* Strong use of TS types throughout (`tsconfig.lib.json`)
* Works in both SSR and client contexts
* Stateless `t()` allows use in tests or non-React tools
* Fully tree-shakeable exports via barrel file

@trinity/locales

### ✅ Key Notes

* **No build or test** targets are needed as this package only contains static JSON dictionaries.
* **Tags** are included for easy filtering and enforcement of architectural constraints.
* **Linting and formatting** are still important, especially to enforce valid and readable JSON.
* **Still needs to be properly set up with translations and it isn't optimized.
* **Does it need a project.json file?.

---

---

## 🔍 1. Package Audit – `@trinity/types`

### ✅ Purpose

This package serves as the centralized source for type definitions used throughout the Trinity Monorepo. It enables consistent data modeling and shared contracts across backend services, frontend apps, and utility libraries.

### 📦 Exports

Each `src/*.ts` file exports strongly typed interfaces, enums, and branded primitives. The `index.ts` file serves as a barrel for all these exports:

* `User`, `UserRole`
* `Club`, `ClubId`
* `Event`, `EventId`
* `Post`, `PostStatus`
* `Member`, `MemberRole`
* `AuthSession`, `LoginStrategy`
* Utility types like `BrandedId`, `UUID`, `Timestamp`

### 📚 Dependencies

This is a type-only package with **zero runtime dependencies**. Development-only dependencies include:

* `tsd` for type testing
* `typescript`
* `vitest` (not used directly in this package but compatible)
* `@trinity/config-typescript`, `@trinity/config-eslint`, etc.

### 📁 Existing Files

All expected files are present:

* ✅ `project.json`
* ✅ `README.md`
* ✅ `tsconfig.*.json`
* ✅ `eslint.config.mjs`
* ✅ `vite.config.ts`
* ✅ Unit tests (`*.test-d.ts`) in `__tests__/`

### 🧠 Types

Types are clear, semantically structured, and use branding (`Branded<T, Label>`) for safe IDs.

### 🪶 Tree-Shakeability

As this is a **pure type-only package**, there is no runtime output to tree-shake. It’s safe to import in any app or library.

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

* ✅ All major modules are tested with `tsd` in `__tests__/*.test-d.ts`
* ✅ Compile-time validation of interfaces
* 🧪 Optional: add runtime validation strategies using `zod` or `class-validator`

---

## 💡 Usage Example

```ts
import type { User, Club, MemberRole } from '@trinity/types';

const user: User = {
  id: 'abc123',
  name: 'Marc Ive',
  email: 'marc@trinity.org',
  role: 'admin'
};
```

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Gaps

* ⚠️ No runtime validation for external API data
* ⚠️ No versioning strategy for types (yet)
* ⚠️ Some `any` types in `common.ts` could be refined

---

## ✅ Best Practices Summary

* Use branded types for unique identifiers
* Never use runtime imports from this package
* Keep interfaces granular and composable
* Use `tsd` tests for every new type file

````

---

## 🧪 3. Testing & QA

### ✅ Existing Test Coverage
Every module has a matching `.test-d.ts` file in `__tests__/`, using `tsd`:

- `auth.test-d.ts` ensures `AuthSession` and token shapes are correct
- `club.test-d.ts` validates club types
- `common.test-d.ts` checks utility types like `Branded` and `UUID`
- Others follow the same pattern

### 🧪 Recommendations
- Continue using `tsd` as the primary strategy
- Add `README` badge indicating type safety coverage
- Optionally integrate with `vitest` for dev ergonomics, but no need for runtime tests

---

## ⚙️ 4. Setup & Integration

### ✅ project.json

Already defined

### ✅ README

The README exists and includes purpose, usage, and example. Suggested enhancements:

* Add full export table (like above)
* Add a “Maintainers” section
* Include `tsd` testing instructions

### ✅ Vite + IDE

`vite.config.ts` is valid and ensures excellent IDE support across editors. Fully TS-native.

---

## ✅ Final Deliverables Summary

# @trinity/ui

## ✅ 1. **Confirm Export Structure in `src/index.ts`**

Your `libs/ui/src/index.ts` should **explicitly export** every component, utility, and helper function you intend to use externally:

### ✔️ Example:

```ts
export * from './components/button';
export * from './components/card';
export * from './components/input';
export * from './components/accordion';
export * from './components/textarea';
export * from './components/dropdown-menu';
export * from './components/navigation-menu';
export * from './components/sheet';
export * from './components/alert';

export * from './lib/utils'; // includes `cn`
```

🔍 **Review Tip:** If any component is missing here, it will not be available when imported in `apps/docs`.

---

## ✅ 2. **Ensure Correct Build Output via `project.json` and `tsconfig`**

You've already created a `project.json` that targets the main file at:

```json
"main": "libs/ui/src/index.ts"
```

To **build and test exports**, run:

```bash
nx build ui
```

Then verify the generated `dist/libs/ui/index.js` or `index.d.ts` includes everything expected.

---

## ✅ 3. **Write Runtime Tests in `apps/docs`**

To **confirm the public API works**, add a runtime test file inside `apps/docs/src/__tests__/ui/exports.test.ts`:

### 🧪 `exports.test.ts`

```ts
import {
  Button,
  Card,
  Input,
  Accordion,
  DropdownMenu,
  NavigationMenu,
  Textarea,
  Sheet,
  Alert,
  cn
} from '@trinity/ui';

describe('@trinity/ui public API', () => {
  it('should export Button component', () => {
    expect(Button).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('should export cn utility', () => {
    expect(typeof cn).toBe('function');
  });

  it('should export all major components', () => {
    expect(Card).toBeDefined();
    expect(Input).toBeDefined();
    expect(Accordion).toBeDefined();
    expect(DropdownMenu).toBeDefined();
    expect(NavigationMenu).toBeDefined();
    expect(Textarea).toBeDefined();
    expect(Sheet).toBeDefined();
    expect(Alert).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

> This validates that your `@trinity/ui` **exports are usable** from other apps like `@trinity/docs`.

---

## ✅ 4. **Use an Example Page in `apps/docs`**

Add a usage demo inside `apps/docs/pages/ui-demo.tsx` to showcase real component usage:

```tsx
import { Button, Card } from '@trinity/ui';

export default function UIDemoPage() {
  return (
    <Card className="p-6">
      <h1 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">UI Demo</h1>
      <Button variant="default">Click me</Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

> If this **renders without error**, you're fully integrated.

---

## 📌 Bonus Checks

### 🧩 Enable Path Aliases in `apps/docs/tsconfig.json`

Ensure the `paths` are set up to resolve `@trinity/ui`:

```json
"paths": {
  "@trinity/ui": ["../../libs/ui/src/index.ts"]
}
```

### 🧪 Ensure `vitest` works in `apps/docs`:

In `apps/docs/project.json`, ensure there's a test target:

```json
"test": {
  "executor": "@nx/vite:test",
  "options": {
    "passWithNoTests": true
  }
}
```

---

## ✅ Summary: Export Verification Checklist

| Check                                       | Status        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `src/index.ts` exports all modules          | 🔲 Review     |
| `project.json` & `tsconfig.lib.json` valid  | ✅ Yes         |
| Runtime test for exports in `apps/docs`     | 🔲 Needed     |
| UI demo page in `apps/docs`                 | 🔲 Optional   |
| TypeScript `paths` alias in `tsconfig.json` | ✅ Recommended |

formatDate('2025-01-01'); // "01 Jan 2025"
slugify('Hello World!'); // "hello-world"
sanitizeHTML('<script>') // ""
await apiClient('/api/posts');
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

All utility functions are unit-tested using [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/).

### Testing Coverage

* ✅ **Unit tests**: Each function is tested in isolation, ensuring correct behavior.
* ✅ **Edge Cases**: Tests include various input cases, such as empty strings, invalid formats, and special characters.
* ✅ **SSR-safe Mocks**: The package handles server-side rendering (SSR) environments.

### Running Tests

```bash
pnpm vitest libs/utils
```

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues or Gaps

* **No React-specific utilities**: The package does not include utilities for React or DOM manipulation, as it is framework-agnostic.

---

## ✅ Best Practices Summary

* **Pure Functions**: All utilities are designed as stateless, side-effect-free functions.
* **SSR-Compatible**: These utilities are safe for server-side rendering environments.
* **Tree-Shakable**: Only the functions you import are included in your build, keeping bundles small.
* **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests ensure the reliability of each utility.

## 🔗 Related Packages

* [`@trinity/types`](../types) – Shared types used across utilities.
* [`@trinity/i18n`](../i18n) – Format functions like `formatDate`.
* [`@trinity/api-client`](../api-client) – API client may be replaced or supplemented by `apiClient` in some cases.
